# Plugin inventory

This page is generated from `extensions/*/package.json`, `openclaw.plugin.json`,
and the root npm package `files` exclusions. Regenerate it with:

```bash
pnpm plugins:inventory:gen
```

## Definitions

- **Core npm package:** built into the `openclaw` npm package and available without a separate plugin install.
- **Official external package:** OpenClaw-maintained plugin omitted from the core npm package, kept in this official inventory, and installed on demand through ClawHub and/or npm.
- **Source checkout only:** repo-local plugin omitted from published npm artifacts and not advertised as an installable package.

Source checkouts are different from npm installs: after `pnpm install`, bundled
plugins load from `extensions/<id>` so local edits and package-local workspace
dependencies are available.

## Install a plugin

Use the install route in each entry to decide whether install is needed. Plugins
that say `included in OpenClaw` are already present in the core package.
Official external packages need one install, then a Gateway restart.

For example, Discord is an official external package:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/discord
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw plugins inspect discord --runtime --json
```

During the launch cutover, ordinary bare package specs still install from npm.
Use `clawhub:@openclaw/discord` or `npm:@openclaw/discord` when you need an
explicit source. After install, follow the plugin's setup doc, such as
[Discord](/channels/discord), to add credentials and channel config. See
[Manage plugins](/plugins/manage-plugins) for update, uninstall, and publishing
commands.

Each entry lists the package, distribution route, description, and exposed
surface.
